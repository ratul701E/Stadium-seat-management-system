                                         Admin Features: The admin has the power to add or delete tickets, edit match details,
                                             control seat quality, and quantity, manage client info, and change anything if 
                                                   necessary. The admin can even communicate with the client via mail. 


                                           Client Features: Clients can create an account and sign in to buy tickets. All the 
                                            clients are given a 1000 BDT by default, but they can mail the admins to deposit
                                             money to purchase tickets if they need more. The clients can buy tickets for a
                                             particular game using a unique match id. They can cancel their tickets anytime 
                                              they want to. If the match is canceled, the client will get a mail from the 
                                              admin regarding the cancellation. The clients can mail the admins anytime if 
                                             they need any help. History of all the purchases made and refunded are stored 
                                                                      in the history section.

                                                   All the data of both admins and clients are stored in the database.
